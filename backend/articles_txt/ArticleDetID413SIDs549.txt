Canvas – Custom Course Creation
Canvas – Custom Course Creation
OU faculty, staff and students have the ability to create non-course shells in Canvas, such as for faculty search groups, department committees and student organizations.
CREATING A CUSTOM COURSE
Go to the
Dashboard
by clicking the icon on the Global Navigation Bar. The Dashboard is also the first page you see when you log in.
In the Dashboard sidebar, click the
Start a New Course
button. You may need to scroll down to see this button.
Add your course name by typing in the
Course Name
field. If your course name is longer than 21 characters, you can create a course code in the
Short Name
field.
Set the content license by selecting the content license drop-down menu. This setting will help Canvas keep track of the default license for content inside of your course. By default all content is considered copyrighted, but you can also release your content to the public domain or choose a Creative Commons license. Learn more about
Creative Commons licenses
. You can also
change the license
later in the course Settings.
If you want to make the course available to anyone with a Canvas account, click the checkbox next to
Make course publicly visible (student data will remain private)
.
Click the
Create course
button.
View the new course.
