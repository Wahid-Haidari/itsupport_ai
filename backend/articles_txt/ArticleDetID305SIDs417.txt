This article will provide step-by-step instructions to get attendance reports from Zoom meetings. Reports for each meeting are generated and will have a list of attendees for that meeting. There may be duplicate attendees if someone left and rejoined for example.
Sign into the Zoom website (oklahoma.zoom.us).
On the side bar on the left side of the page, you will click on
Reports
, and this will take you to the
Usage Reports.
Next click
Usage
where you will able to view meetings, participants, and other date in a specified date range.
Set the date range to the day you are wanting data from, click the search button, and Zoom will show the meetings in that range.
You can either export this data as a CSV file to see the participant info or you can click the number of participants to view the list of participants.
