Enabling Security on Android
Enabling Security on Android
Note: because some models of Android phones use different versions and/or layouts of the OS, these instructions will vary; these instructions were created using stock Android 4.2.2.
To enable a security lock (PIN, Password, or Pattern), you will need to do the following:
Open the
Settings
app, and go to “
Security
” (under the Personal section)
Select the type of screen security you wish to enable (default is “
Slide
“)
You can choose from
Slide
,
Face Unlock
,
Pattern
,
PIN
, or
Password
Slide
and
Face Unlock
are the least secure and are thus not recommended
If you select “
Pattern
,” you will be prompted to select a size of pattern before drawing it.
Once you select your method of security, enter the PIN/Password or draw your pattern and hit “Next”
You will be asked to confirm the new pattern or PIN/Password before saving.
