MyMedia - ADA Compliant Captions
MyMedia - ADA Compliant Captions
While Kaltura MyMedia has AI captions automatically added to any video uploaded, they do not meet the ADA required percentage of accuracy. The University of Oklahoma has a contract with a vendor to provide ADA level captions. If you have a request for ADA compliant captions on a video associated with a student, please have them fill out the
request form
from the Oklahoma Accessibility and Disability Resource Center.
If you have a non-course related video that needs ADA captions for public use, please email
hessman@ou.edu
for pricing and instructions on how to order captions via MyMedia. Please know billing information will be required to order captions.
