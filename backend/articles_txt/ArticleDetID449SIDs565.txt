Students: The Calendar helps students see what assignments and events are coming up in the course. You can also create personal events such as study groups.

When would I use the Calendar as a student?

View course calendars (https://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/710322-how-do-i-use-the-calendar-as-a-student) and group calendars (https://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/81728?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=4212).

Create personal calendar reminders (https://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/716710-how-do-i-add-an-event-to-my-calendar-as-a-student).

Filter the calendar view (https://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/54670?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=4212) to only see specific calendars.
