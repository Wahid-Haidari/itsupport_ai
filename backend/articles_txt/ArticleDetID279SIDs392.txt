Different types of OU accounts expire after different amounts of time, per OUâ€™s account expiration policy. For information about specific types of accounts and their expiration dates, please see the Account Expiration Policy  (https://itsupport.ou.edu/TDClient/30/Unified/KB/ArticleDet?ID=265)article.

The list below includes instructions on how former account holders may be able to continue to utilize some services that were available to them while affiliated with OU. 

 

LinkedIn Learning Access

LinkedIn Learning is licensed for current OU faculty, staff and students only. Depending on one's current location and local offerings, one may be able to continue to utilize these services in a different format.

Some of the Lynda.com and LinkedIn content is available through many public library systems. Norman Public Library does not provide access to the content, but the OKC Metropolitan Library System (MLS) does. More information is located here (https://www.metrolibrary.org/find/research-and-learn/online-learning). MLS offers a reciprocal library card to users who live or work in a few surrounding counties, including Cleveland County. More information about reciprocal accounts can be found at the MLS site (https://www.metrolibrary.org/about-us/accounts). 

To access research databases, Bizzell will issue temporary guest IDs for users to access databases while in the library. Unfortunately, remote access is not available. A list of the OU Library System alumni offerings can be found here (https://libraries.ou.edu/content/alumni-retiree-privileges).

A list of available databases offered through the Metropolitan Library System is located here (https://www.metrolibrary.org/find/research-and-learn/databases-a-z). Other local libraries (including the Pioneer Library System in Norman) may also have access to some databases.

Handshake is a career management platform that connects one to relevant job opportunities based on their profile, interests, and search activity. Any alumnus of the University of Oklahoma must have an alumni.ou.edu email address to create/reactivate a Handshake account. Instructions for setting up your new email account can be found here (https://www.ou.edu/alumni/license). Once you have your new email address, please email oucs@ou.edu (mailto:oucs@ou.edu) with your new email address and request to have your Handshake account reinstated. Please provide the year you graduated as well as the first and last name you had while a student at OU. If you remember your student ID or OU OUNetID, that is helpful as well. If you have never used Handshake before, please follow the instructions here (https://www.ou.edu/career/alumni/handshake) to create an account. Questions about this process should be directed to Career Services.

OU Create allows current OU faculty, staff, and students a platform for creating a personal website. To access this content, the individual must be an active OUNetID account holder. If one is no longer an account holder and needs to access their content, they should contact create@ou.edu (mailto:create@ou.edu) and request assistance with retrieving their website data.
