Microsoft Teams Security
By default, only Teams members can access stored files. Exercise caution when authorizing access to Teams files.
Create different channels in Teams to direct conversations to authorized individuals only.
Share files to Teams with specific individuals, never with "everyone" or the "public".
Regularly review shared files by clicking the Files menu in any version of the Teams app (mobile, desktop, or web), and selecting Microsoft Teams or Recent to view history.
