HIPAA and FERPA policy for Qualtrics
HIPAA and FERPA policy for Qualtrics
The University of Oklahoma has executed a HIPAA Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with Qualtrics allowing the Health Science Center health care components (HCC) to utilize the Qualtrics online survey and analytics tool with ePHI.
With this update, please know that the use of University PHI for research, analytics, and reporting is still governed by the University’s HIPAA polices (
https://apps.ouhsc.edu/hipaa/secured/default.asp?page=policies.
) If you have any questions, please reach out to the University’s HIPAA Compliance Team at
oucompliance@ouhsc.edu
Qualtrics is still not authorized for FERPA data.
