LinkedIn Learning – Learning Paths & Collections
LinkedIn Learning – Learning Paths & Collections
Use the learning paths and collections (formerly playlists) on LinkedIn Learning to find and engage with content that best suits your Learning needs. Collections are an easy way to organize courses and videos you’d like to review later. You can create as many collections as you’d like, around topics or themes that fit your learning needs. Each collection can be expanded, edited, and updated as you meet or change your learning goals. Learning paths are compiled playlists of related video courses on a specific topic or career track. They include multiple courses by different expert instructors to teach a variety of skills and information associated with that subject or profession.
