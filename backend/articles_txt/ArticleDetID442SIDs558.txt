Canvas – ePortfolios – About ePortfolios
Students
: An ePortfolio is a place for you to showcase your good work from a course or academic program. ePortfolios can be used for course projects, but they can also be used by student organizations to create a simple web presence.
ePortfolios in Canvas are basic websites divided into Sections (left-hand navigation) and Pages (right-hand navigation) nested inside of each Section.
Instructors
: Instructors, use ePortfolios to:
Create an online educational journal for reflection
Create an online site that can be turned in as an online Assignment
Demonstrate mastery of course Outcomes
Share your best work from multiple courses
Showcase professional-quality work for prospective employers
