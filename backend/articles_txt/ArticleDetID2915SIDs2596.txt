Microsoft Forms Security
You can control whether or not external users are allowed to collaborate with users in your organization on a form or quiz.
On the
Microsoft Forms
pane, the
Share
setting has three options:
Send a link to the form to people outside of your organization and collect responses from external people.
Collaborate on the form (e.g. edit questions, change the theme design) with people outside of your organization.
Share the form as a template so people outside of your organization can duplicate the form for their own purposes.
