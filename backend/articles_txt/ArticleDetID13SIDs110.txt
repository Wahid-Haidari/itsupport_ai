LinkedIn Learning

LinkedIn Learning
is an online learning platform that enables individuals and organizations to achieve their objectives and aspirations. It has all the same great content formerly featured on Lynda.com, but with special insights and social engagement offered on LinkedIn.
With more than 5,000 courses and personalized recommendations, you can discover, complete, and track courses related to your field and interests. You can also choose to add these courses and related skills to your LinkedIn profile once you’ve completed them.
User account information, learning history (courses watched, courses saved, etc.), and certificates of completion from their Lynda.com account will be migrated to their LinkedIn Learning subscription.
Accessing LinkedIn Learning (recommended method):
Users can access LinkedIn Learning by navigating to
lynda.ou.edu
and entering their OU Credentials (OUNetID and Password) at the Single Sign On (SSO) page.
Logging in methods:
When users go to l
ynda
.ou.edu
and log in for the first time, they will be asked whether or not they want to connect their LinkedIn Learning account with their LinkedIn profile (they have the option to decline). During this “activation” process, if they choose to connect their LinkedIn profile with their LinkedIn Learning account, on future logins, it’ll prompt them to log in with SSO, then their LinkedIn credentials. If they choose
not
to connect their LinkedIn profile with their LinkedIn learning account during this process, it will only prompt for SSO on future logins.
For those that have paired their LinkedIn profiles with their LinkedIn Learning account, they can access the Learning content from Linkedin; if they log in to linkedin.com, then click on the Learning button, it will prompt them for SSO.
To login for the first time via SSO (without connecting accounts):
Go to
lynda.ou.edu
and log in with your OU credentials.
Users will receive a prompt to connect their LinkedIn account; select ‘
Continue without connecting my LinkedIn account
‘.
Enter your job title.
Enter your desired skills (or skip this step).
You should now be able to access content.
