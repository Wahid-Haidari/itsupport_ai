What is the LastPass Master Password?
What is the LastPass Master Password?
The Master Password is the password that you are prompted to create when you initially sign up for your LastPass account. When you log in to LastPass, you need your email address and Master Password to access your account. It is very important that you create a very strong Master Password that you will not forget.
When it comes to securing your LastPass Vault, it's very important that the Master Password that you create and maintain is long and unique. Although there are many layers of encryption and security we put in place to keep your data safe, using a strong Master Password will not only protect you from brute-force attacks, but will also ensure that a breach at another website won't affect your LastPass account.
LastPass recommends using the following best practices when creating your Master Password:
Use a minimum of 12 characters, but the lengthier the better
Use upper case, lower case, numeric, and special character values
Make it pronounceable and memorable, but not easily guessed (e.g., a passphrase)
Make sure that it is unique only to you
Never use personal information
A good example is: Fidoate!my2woolsox
It is strongly recommended that you never re-use your Master Password for any other account or application; this password is intended only for your LastPass account. To help commit your Master Password to memory, log in to your LastPass account several times.
Please be aware that OU and LastPass Customer Care has no knowledge of a user's Master Password. It is not possible for us to reset or change a user's Master Password if it is forgotten.
