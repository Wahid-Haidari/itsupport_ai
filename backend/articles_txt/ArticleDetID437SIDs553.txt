Canvas – People – About People
Students:
Students can use the People page to do the following:
View all the users participating in the course, including the ones whose course enrollment is pending.
Use the search bar to find a specific person.
Use the drop-down menu to filter users by role. The filter will also display the number of users in each type of role [e.g. student, TA].
View user groups in the course.
View registered services for course users.
Instructors:
The People page displays all information about the users in your course, either added by your or your institution via SIS import. You can add a user to the course, manage student groups, and view user status.
Enrolled students should automatically appear in your course. Contact OU IT if they do not appear automatically. In the instance that you do need to add a user manually, they must be added by Login ID. Visit our article on
Adding Users
,
for more information.
