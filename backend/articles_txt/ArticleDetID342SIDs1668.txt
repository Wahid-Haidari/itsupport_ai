Qualtrics - Activate Your Account
Qualtrics - Activate Your Account
OU provides access to Qualtrics for
faculty, staff, and students. The first time you log into Qualtrics, your account must be activated. The process for doing so is described and illustrated in the steps below.
Visit
the URL
survey.ou.edu
.
The OU SSO page will appear.
Log in with your
OUNetID (4x4)  or OUHSC Username and password.
Select
No, I don’t have a preexisting
account here
.
Click
Sign In
.
You will now be on the Qualtrics home page (your full list of surveys will be on the Projects page found in the navigation menu). A short, automated tour of the platform will demonstrate navigation and introduce optional
Basecamp
trainings.
Now that your account is
activated, you will just need to log in normally each time at
survey.ou.edu
.
If you have any problems with activating your account, please call OU IT at 405-325-HELP (4357)
.
