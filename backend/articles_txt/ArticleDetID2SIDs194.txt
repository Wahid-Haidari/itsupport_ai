
  Account Recovery E-Mail


The first time a user logs into https://accounts.ou.edu (https://accounts.ou.edu/) they will need to enter an alternate e-mail address for account recovery.

This e-mail address cannot be an ou.edu e-mail address. Thereafter, the alternate e-mail can be modified the same as any other data on the page.

If you are unable to access your OU account because you no longer have access to your alternate e-mail address, you will need to contact OU IT by calling 325-HELP (4357) or needhelp.ou.edu for assistance.
