Students and Instructors
: Canvas leverages cloud technology to allow multiple users to work together on the same document at the same time. Collaborative documents are saved in real-time, meaning a change made by any of its users will be immediately visible to everyone. Collaborations can be created using Google Docs or Microsoft 365.
Note
:
Google Docs allows you to add up to 50 users per collaboration, and all users can view and edit a document at the same time. However, Google collaborations has a limit as to the number of users who can access a collaboration at any time. Learn more about creating a
Google Collaboration.
