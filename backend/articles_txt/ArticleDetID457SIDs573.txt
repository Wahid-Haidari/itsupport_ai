Canvas – Combining Sections into One Canvas Course
Canvas – Combining Sections into One Canvas Course
Instructors can combine multiple sections into a single course in Canvas.
Note
:
You can only combine courses in which you are listed as an instructor; you cannot combine another instructor's course with your own.
Make sure to combine sections before publishing the Canvas course. We also recommend combining your courses BEFORE adding course material. If there is an error in combining your courses, course content and activities setup in the original existing courses may be deleted once a course is combined.
Any existing student activity (discussions/assignment submissions/grades) could also be affected and combining courses after students have submitted work is not recommended.
If you have already added content to your course, we recommend creating a back-up copy of your course content before combining courses (student submissions will not be backed-up). To create a back-up copy:
Copy the course content from the official course(s) to a new course:
How Do I Copy a Canvas Course?
Combine your official courses
Copy content back into official course (if necessary):
How do I import content from another Canvas course?
Note
:
Please verify start and end dates for each section that was combined; individual section start and end dates are maintained, even after combining courses.
