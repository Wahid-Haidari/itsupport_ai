MyMedia – Attachments
The Attachments tab in the video editing portion of MyMedia allows you to add additional materials to your project in the form of supplemental files.
Log in at mymedia.ou.edu with your OUNetID and password
Click on the tab with
your name
(or
log in
) and then
My Media
on the top menu.
Choose which video you would like information about.
Underneath the lower-right-hand corner of the video, there exists a drop-down menu; select
Edit
from it.
This will bring you to the
General Editing Menu
. This view allows you to preview your video, and choose a number of options using the tabs under the video.
Clicking on the
Attachments Tab
will bring up selected files that are provided by members allowed to edit the content metadata and related assets.
The “
Upload File
” button on the bottom right allows for additions of files by authorized accounts. Use the File Explorer to choose your file, provide a Title and a Description.
The attached files can easily be managed below the video in an easy-to-read table, where videos can be edited, deleted or downloaded.
