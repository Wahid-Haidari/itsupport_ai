Once the student submits their media, a course moderator/instructor will receive an approval request. All pending approval submission will be listed in the Pending Tab. 

Check the box on the left of the pending media.



To approve or reject the submission, click on the approve or reject button respectively. (Note: approving the media automatically publishes it to the course media gallery and can be added to a course gallery playlist, if you choose to do so). 

 

If a student visits the media gallery before moderatorsâ€™ approval, student will receive a reminder that their media is still pending approval.
