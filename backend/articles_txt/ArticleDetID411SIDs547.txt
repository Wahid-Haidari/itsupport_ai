Canvas – Adding Users to Course
Canvas – Adding Users to Course
Adding Users to Course
As an instructor, you can enroll users as TAs, instructors, etc. in your Canvas course.
To add a user to your course:
In your course, click on
People
in the navigation bar, then click
+People
.
Under
Add user(s) by
, select
Login ID.
Do not add users by email address, as this creates a duplicate account that is not tied to their OU account.
In the box, type or copy/paste in the
OUNet ID
(also known as the 4x4) of the user(s) you would like to add to the course. If you are adding multiple users, separate their OUNet IDs with a comma.
Choose the
Role
the user(s) should have and the
Section
they should be added to (if necessary). If you are adding multiple users at once, they will all be given the same permissions.
If desired, check the box next to
Can interact with users in their section only
to restrict the user’s access
.
Hit the
Next
button.
You will see a verification screen. If the information is correct, click
Add Users
.
If you need to add additional users with different permissions, repeat steps 1-7.
