Editing Captions within MyMedia
Editing Captions within MyMedia
NOTE:
All new videos added will be auto-captioned. Un-edited captions will only be 70/80% accuracy. Please edit captions for higher accuracy.
Log In into your MyMedia account
Go to your library by clicking on
“MyMedia”
under your profile
Select the video for which you would like to edit captions and go to the
Editing
menu by clicking on the pen-like icon in the far right
You can play your video to verify that it now has captions. However, these WILL NOT be 100% accurate.
To proof-read and edit the machine produced captions, click on the blue
Edit Captions
button
Once in the Closed Captions Editor, you can modify the times at which text appears and disappears, as well as what text is being shown for each frame by simply clicking on the text boxes.
Click on the
Save
blue button when you are done editing.
