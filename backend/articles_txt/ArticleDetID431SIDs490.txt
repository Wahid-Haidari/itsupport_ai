Create.ou.edu (http://create.ou.edu/) offers students, faculty, and staff the opportunity to build and maintain a digital identity by facilitating both the registration of web domains (.com, .org, .net) or subdomain and easy installation of popular open-source applications such as WordPress, MediaWiki, Drupal, and Omeka. In providing users with access to these tools, Create aims to empower all members of the OU community to craft and control their digital narrative through the use of blogs, portfolios, wikis, and more.
