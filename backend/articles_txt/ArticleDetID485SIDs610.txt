Connecting to WIFI@OU with iOS
Connecting to WIFI@OU with iOS
Go to Settings and then Wi-Fi.
Select WIFI@OU as the network.
For "Username", if you are a Norman campus user, enter your OUNetID; if you are an HSC campus user, enter your HSC username. Then enter your OU password.
Choose "Trust" in the top right corner when prompted to verify the Certificate.
Please note: If you have attempted to connect to any other OU networks such as OUGuest, you will need to first "forget" that network before attempting to connect to WIFI@OU.  For instructions on forgetting a wireless network, refer to the
"Forgetting a Wireless Network"
article.
