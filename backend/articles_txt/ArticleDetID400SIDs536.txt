
  Accessing Lockdown Browser to Take a Quiz


To install Respondus on your computer, visit https://link.ou.edu/respondus (https://link.ou.edu/respondus) to download the OU-specific software. Because we have a combined license with HSC, under the Install section, you will see the following: Install LockDown Browser for
University of Oklahoma Health Science Center. You will need to click the yellow Install button, then follow the install prompts on your computer.

Launch Lockdown Browser. This article will appear as the homepage. Then, click on this Canvas URL to access your quiz: https://canvas.ou.edu (https://canvas.ou.edu/)

 

Students enrolled in HSC programs, please go to Brightspace by D2L https://learn.ouhsc.edu/ (https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Flearn.ouhsc.edu%2F&data=05%7C01%7Ccarolynhewes%40ou.edu%7C033c8a51be5949fea76408da98188e7a%7C9c7de09d903444c1b462c464fece204a%7C1%7C0%7C637989528475203666%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=OvcfZRO6vB%2BXv0RYVZUrcCjGbFN6yhGBiK9CtENfZa0%3D&reserved=0) to download and install Respondus LDB to use in your quizzes.  

The download link is available under the Assessments menu in most of your courses.  Alternatively, once you log into Brightspace, click on the red navigation bar menu Brightspace Help > LockDown Browser Installer.  

You must first go to your Brightspace course and start your quiz taking process there.  After clicking on a quiz to enter, a “Launch LockDown Browser” button will appear at the bottom of the page. This is where you will then start LockDown Browser.

After the initial download and installation of the software, LockDown Browser is only ever launched from within a Brightspace by D2L quiz. If you start the LockDown Browser app BEFORE you start your quiz process, you will end up back on this page.
