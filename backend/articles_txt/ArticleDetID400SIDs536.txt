How to Install LockDown Browser:
Students enrolled in HSC programs, please go to Brightspace by D2L

How to take a quiz with LockDown Browser in Brightspace by D2L:
You must first go to your Brightspace course and start your quiz taking process there.  After clicking on a quiz to enter, a “Launch LockDown Browser” button will appear at the bottom of the page. This is where you will then start LockDown Browser.
After the initial download and installation of the software, LockDown Browser is only ever launched from within a Brightspace by D2L quiz.
If you start the LockDown Browser app BEFORE you start your quiz process, you will end up back on this page.
