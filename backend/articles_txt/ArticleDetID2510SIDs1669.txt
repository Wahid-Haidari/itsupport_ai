Qualtrics – Editing an Active Survey
Qualtrics – Editing an Active Survey
Before making changes to an active survey, review Qualtrics's
recommendations for editing an active survey
to
avoid losing or altering data
.
Once you are certain your changes will not affect your data, you can begin editing. Your edits will be saved as a survey version. After the edits are complete,
the survey must be republished
to make the changes visible to respondents. Check out this guide on
Survey Publishing and Versions
to understand when and how your changes will go live.
