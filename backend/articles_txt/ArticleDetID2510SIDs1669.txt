Before making changes to an active survey, review Qualtrics's recommendations for editing an active survey (https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/testing-and-editing-an-active-survey/#EditingAnActiveSurvey) to avoid losing or altering data.

Once you are certain your changes will not affect your data, you can begin editing. Your edits will be saved as a survey version. After the edits are complete, the survey must be republished to make the changes visible to respondents. Check out this guide on Survey Publishing and Versions (https://www.qualtrics.com/support/survey-platform/survey-module/survey-publishing-versions/) to understand when and how your changes will go live.
