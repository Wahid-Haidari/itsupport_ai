Adding Sooner Card to your Android Phone
Adding Sooner Card to your Android Phone
Add your Sooner Card to your Android Device and use it anywhere the physical Sooner Card is accepted.
Here’s what you need:
Your NFC-enabled Android device
To ensure NFC is enabled, go to Settings > Connections and toggle the NFC “switch” to on. On some devices this may be under Settings > Connected Devices > Connection Preferences. You can also go to Settings and type "NFC" in the search box. If you have NFC capabilities on your device you will see NFC options displayed. Depending on your Android device and/or operating system, your steps may vary.
