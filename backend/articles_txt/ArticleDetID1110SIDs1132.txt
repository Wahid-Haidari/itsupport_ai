If you are logged in to Office 365, you will have the ability to view your Office account information by clicking your name in the upper right hand corner of your Office 365 online application. This profile information will offer a "Password" option for the account. Please note that this functionality will not work for OU accounts. One can not reset their OU password through the Office 365 profile area, attempting to do so will result in a "You can’t change your password here" message. If you need to change your OU password, you may do so through one.ou.edu (https://one.ou.edu). Please follow those instructions here (https://itsupport.ou.edu/TDClient/30/Unified/KB/ArticleDet?ID=212).
