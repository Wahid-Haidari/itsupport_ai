In an effort to maintain productivity and maximize flexibility as the University responds to COVID-19, OU IT has extended the VMware Horizon Virtual Desktop service (VDI) to tri-campus Faculty and Staff.
Please note, you will need to install PingID and then authenticate to get access to this program, please see

for more.
VDI delivers a CLEAN desktop with secure, encrypted access to network services.
VDI does NOT duplicate your on-campus desktop computer.
Files stored locally on your on-campus computer are not accessible via VDI.
Accessing VDI via the Client:
