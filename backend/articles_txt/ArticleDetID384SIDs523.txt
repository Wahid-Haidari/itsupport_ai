Creating an SRT file
Creating an SRT file
If you don’t want to pay for captioning, it is possible to create your own captions, in what is called an SRT file. All you need is a basic text editor, such as Notepad.
Open your text editor and go to
File
and then
Save as
.
On the drop-down menu for file type, select
All Files
Save the file as
YourVideoName.srt
In the document, type a
1
, then hit
Enter
Insert the time at which you want the first line of captions to start in
HH:MM:SS,sss
format (where sss is milliseconds.) Both hours and milliseconds are required.
add
–>
and then in the same timestamp format, when you want the caption line to end. Hit
Enter
.
Type the line of the caption. Hit
Enter twice
.
Type a
2
, and then repeat for the second line of captions.
It should look something like this:1
00:00:00,010 –> 00:00:08,052

00:00:08,064 –> 00:00:16,057

multi-genre research paper
Continue for as many captions as you need for your video, keeping a line break between each caption line.
You can do basic formatting such as <i>text</i> to make text italicized or bold.
Making an SRT file can take some time, but it isn’t too difficult to do. You can also upload the video to a site such as YouTube and have it create its own captions, then clean them up (YouTube is not 100% accurate, and jargon makes it significantly less accurate).
