Kaltura Capture: Installation and Basic Functionality
Kaltura Capture: Installation and Basic Functionality
To begin the installation process for Kaltura Capture, you first must navigate to the MyMedia page, located at
https://mymedia.ou.edu
.
Login by clicking
“
Guest
.”
This will open a
drop-down menu where you can click
“
Login”
button
. You will see the OU SSO page where you can enter your
OUNet
ID
and password.
You will be redirected to the home page, where you must click the
“Add New”
drop-down menu and select the option
“Kaltura Capture (Replacing
CaptureSpace)”
.
This will bring you to a screen which provides links to download the installation package for your appropriate Operating System (either Windows or Macintosh).
There will be a list of supported system requirements and clicking on the link will prompt a download automatically.
Navigate to the
Downloads
section of your browser and open the installation file. This will open the Kaltura Installer and the process should
complete within a few minutes, depending on the speed of your machine.
A dialog box will then prompt you to return to MyMedia and attempt to click the same Kaltura Capture button under the Add New drop-down menu once again.
This will prompt an External Protocol Request to access the application and launch it from your system. Click
“Launch Application”.
Please note – on Mac OS Catalina, you will need to take the additional step of going to System Preferences, then Security & Privacy, and then grant permission allowing the screen to be recorded.
Voila! You should be staring at the Desktop Recorder!
