Students and Instructors
: Canvas provides an integrated system for class discussions, allowing both instructors and students to start and contribute to as many discussion topics as desired. Discussions can also be created as an assignment for grading purposes (and seamlessly integrated with the Canvas Gradebook), or simply serve as a forum for topical and current events. Discussions can also be created within student groups.
Help students start thinking about an upcoming Assignment or class discussion.
Follow-up on a conversation or questions that began in a face-to-face classroom.
Test student comprehension of important points made in class.
Debate contradictory ideas.
Brainstorm different approaches to a class problem.
