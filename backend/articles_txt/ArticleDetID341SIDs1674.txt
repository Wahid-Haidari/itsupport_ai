HIPPA and FERPA policy

Contact Qualtrics
Qualtrics can also be contacted directly, if desired.
To access the Qualtrics support page:

Click the question mark icon
in the upper right corner.
A popup window with several options will show. Select
Contact Support.
A login screen will appear.
Do not log in on this page
. Instead, click on
Sign in with SSO
.
It will ask for an
Organization ID. Enter
ousurvey
into the field. Once the Organization ID is submitted, it may let you in immediately or you may need to enter your OU Credentials.

There will be multiple topic options to choose from. For most issues, selecting

You can now choose how you would like to contact Qualtrics. Live chat works well for
quick responses to short questions, while email works better for more complex questions and troubleshooting. Once you select an option, you will be asked to fill out a form with your information and a description of the problem.
