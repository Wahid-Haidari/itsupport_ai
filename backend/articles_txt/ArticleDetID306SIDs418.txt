The file is processed and checked for errors. You’ll be notified if you need to update any information.
An email will be sent to the users you’ve added, with instructions on how to activate their accounts. If a user has been added as an inactive user, a welcome email is not sent.
The newly added users appear in People on your administrator account. Initially their status is Invited. After they’ve registered and activated their account, their status changes to Activated. If you have uploaded the user as inactive, they display in the user list as Unassigned.
