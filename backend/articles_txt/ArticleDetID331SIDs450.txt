Adding OU Contacts to your non-OU Skype Account
Adding OU Contacts to your non-OU Skype Account
If you are a non-OU account Skype user, you can add OU contacts to your contact list. Please see below for instructions based on whether you use a Windows machine or Mac.
Please note that in some cases Skype Contact requests to Skype for Business users may not be transmitted. Microsoft is aware of this problem but no solution has currently been published. If your contact request does not go through, you may wish to contact the OU account user and have them add your Skype account to their Contact list, this should complete the Contact approval process and allow their account to appear on your Contact list. This process is outlined
