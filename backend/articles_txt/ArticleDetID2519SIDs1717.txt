OU IT Password Policy Updates
OU IT Password Policy Updates
Updated University Password Policy
OU IT implemented a new University-wide Password Policy for 2021 that aligned OU user password requirements with industry standards for increased cybersecurity. The purpose of this policy is to establish guidance regarding the creation and management of OU accounts to protect the security of the network, protect data integrity, and protect information systems.
The updated OU IT Password Policy was approved in 2020 after collecting feedback from OU and OUHSC faculty and staff through the IT Policy, Standard, & Procedure (PSP) Program. For more information on OU IT's commitment to collaborating with stakeholders to develop IT policies and standards, please visit
