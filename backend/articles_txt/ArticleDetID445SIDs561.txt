Canvas – Inbox – About the Inbox
Canvas – Inbox – About the Inbox
The Inbox is a built-in messaging tool in Canvas. It is used instead of email to communicate with a course, a section, a group, or an individual student. The Inbox allows instructors to message their classes without having to manually create mailing lists. It also provides students with a way to communicate with classmates without having to exchange email addresses.
