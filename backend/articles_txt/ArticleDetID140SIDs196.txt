The Avaya Aura voicemail system requires a password to login. Receiving three password login failures for the system will lock you from your mailbox. If you have locked your voicemail login please visit the Voicemail service (https://itsupport.ou.edu/TDClient/30/Unified/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=9) on the catalog and click Request Service.

If you are a new user for your phone and a previous mailbox is still present on the line that you wish to update, please visit the Voicemail service (https://itsupport.ou.edu/TDClient/30/Unified/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=9) on the catalog and click Request Service. Note that maintaining the existing mailbox and requesting a password reset can be performed without charge. If you wish to wipe out the old mailbox and create a new one, there will be a $10 programming change charge.
