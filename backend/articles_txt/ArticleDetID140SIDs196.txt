Voicemail Login Access Issues
The Avaya Aura voicemail system requires a password to login. Receiving three password login failures for the system will lock you from your mailbox. If you have locked your voicemail login please visit the
Voicemail service
on the catalog and click Request Service.
If you are a new user for your phone and a previous mailbox is still present on the line that you wish to update, please visit the
Voicemail service
on the catalog and click Request Service. Note that maintaining the existing mailbox and requesting a password reset can be performed without charge. If you wish to wipe out the old mailbox and create a new one, there will be a $10 programming change charge.
