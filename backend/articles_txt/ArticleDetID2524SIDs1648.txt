Creating Questions
, or check out this article on
Question Types
for more details.
Previewing
Before making your survey live, it is recommended to preview it. This allows you to ensure that the survey works well on both desktop and mobile, and provides an opportunity to check that any advanced features you have added are functioning properly. Read more about
the Preview feature
.
Publishing and Distribution
When you are ready to make your survey live, you will first need to
publish it
. Then, you can choose from a variety of
distribution options
.
Note: select distribution options (ie, SMS) are not available on all accounts. Please contact OU IT if you need to use SMS or another unavailable option.
If you need to make edits to your survey after publishing, be aware that some edits can affect your data. Before making changes, refer to Qualtrics’s
recommendations for editing an active survey
to
avoid losing or altering data.
Once you have determined it is safe to make changes and have completed the updates,
the survey must be republished
to make the changes visible to respondents.
