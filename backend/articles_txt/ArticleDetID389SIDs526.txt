MyMedia FAQ & Known Issues
FAQS
Who can use MyMedia?
All University of Oklahoma users (Norman, Tulsa, HSC) can login to view, create, and share content in MyMedia.
Why do I see a higher quality video by default than another person located in a different location on campus?
MyMedia utilizes auto sensing to determine the player and streaming type. Not all connections on the same network (on or off campus) will receive the same auto-selected bandwidth.
Why does my video appear pixelated or audio out of sync when I select a higher quality?
Manual selection of the highest bit rate, when the bandwidth connection is not supported, can cause choppy or pixilated playback. In addition, video and audio may become out of sync
Why can’t I access my lecture capture recording from MyMedia?
The recorded media may be tied to an incorrect OUNet ID.
The recorded media may not be done uploading and processing or failed to finish.
