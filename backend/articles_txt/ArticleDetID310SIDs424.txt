Groups are a great way to easily recommend content to a specific set of learners. Users with sub-admin permissions can create groups of learners in their Learning account and quickly recommend courses or learning paths to everyone in the group at one time.

To request a group, please submit your request through the IT Service Catalo (https://itsupport.ou.edu/TDClient/30/Unified/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=99)g.
