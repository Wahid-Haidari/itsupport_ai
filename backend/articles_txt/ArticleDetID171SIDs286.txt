OU Account Management
Please note that account access for new users will be dependent upon being fully entered into and processed by the account systems. For new hires, that can include full processing of paperwork by your hiring manager and by HR. For new students, it can take up to five days after receiving your admissions letter before the account is fully accessible in the system.
If one was an employee who has been terminated or is no longer employed by OU, or if one was a former student and three enrollment periods have passed, then account access will be removed.
Please see
this guide
for some common account access issues.
