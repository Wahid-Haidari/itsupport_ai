Sometimes during wireless usage, your computer or device may have trouble using or reconnecting to a saved wireless connection such as WIFI@OU. You may wish to remove the network, and then re-add it.

From the home screen, choose Settings.
In the settings menu, choose Wi-Fi.
Locate the network in question and tap or press and hold it.
Choose Forget.
If you wish to re-add the network, return to the list of available networks and select to connect to the network in question.

Click OK.
If you wish to re-add the network, return to the list of available networks and select to connect to the network in question.

In the settings menu, choose Wi-Fi.
