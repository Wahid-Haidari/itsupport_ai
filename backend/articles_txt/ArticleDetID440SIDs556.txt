Canvas – Grades – About Grades
Students
: Grades can serve as a communication tool between students and instructors and allow instructors to track the progress of students.
The Gradebook stores all information about student progress in the course, measuring both letter grades and course outcomes.
Instructors
: The Gradebook helps instructors easily input and distribute grades for students. Grades for each assignment can be calculated as points, percentages, complete or incomplete, pass or fail, GPA scale, and letter grades, and assignments can be organized into groups for weighting as well.
You can also use
SpeedGrader
to help you assign out grades.
Columns are automatically created in the Gradebook when you create and publish assignments, graded discussions, and graded quizzes and surveys. A column is also automatically added for the Attendance tool.
