Press the Canvas button on the right side of the screen.
Enter your Canvas login information (OUNet ID and password).
Press
Authorize
in the popup to allow WEPA to access your Canvas documents.
You can now print files that are stored through your Canvas account just like you would from Dropbox or Google Drive.
Navigate to your document(s) through your Canvas directory.
