Canvas – Files – About Files
Students
: As a student, Files allows you to store files and assignments within Canvas. You can upload one or multiple files, view all details about your files, and preview files.
You have access to files (documents, images, media, etc.) in three different places:
User files, located in your user account
Course files, located in each course where you are enrolled (if your instructor allows you to view Course Files)
Group files, located in each group where you are a member
Instructors
: Files are where you upload course files, syllabi, readings, or other documents. As an instructor, you can lock the folders so students cannot access your files. Files can be placed in Modules, Assignments, or Pages. Files and folders are put in alphabetical order and cannot be rearranged.
Canvas users will find access to files (documents, images, media, etc.) in three different places:
Personal files, located in each user’s profile (students, teachers, and TAs)—
View a video about personal files
Course files, located in each course (students, teachers, and TAs unless files are locked by the teacher)—
View a video about Course Files
Group files, located in each group (students and teachers who are enrolled in groups)
