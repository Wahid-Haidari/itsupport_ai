Network Drives and Virtual Labs
Network Drives and Virtual Labs
Virtual lab is a software allowing students to virtually connect to a computer-like environment. Its purpose is to provide students with numerous specialized engineering applications without having to install them on their devices.
Gallogly College of Engineering and Mewbourne College of Earth and Energy provide the virtual lab access to their students
.
In order to access the virtual lab, users need to have
configured PingID
and have a “Remote Desktop Connection” application. Windows devices have a built-in remote desktop client. If you are trying to access a Virtual Lab while off campus, you will also need to connect to VPN first. More information on OU VPN can be found
here
.

Basic Troubleshooting
If you receive an access denied message from an existing set up of virtual lab, try to remove the connection and then re-add it using the connection settings above.
If you have logged in to Virtual Lab in the past using your OU email address as the User Name, you should delete your credentials and log in using sooner\OUNetID
If this is not done, your connection will not properly contact PingID for approval to authenticate your connection.
In Windows this can be accomplished by opening the connection and clicking the "delete" link in "delete these credentials".
If that still does not work, ensure you have access to your account by logging in at one.ou.edu.
You must be currently enrolled in a College of Engineering or College of Earth and Energy course.
If you are connecting from off-campus, you need to connect through the VPN.
If you need assistance, call 405-325-HELP (4357).
