Affiliates of the University may request an exception account to gain access to OU email, network resources, and other services.
Exception accounts require annual approval and must be sponsored by a director or chair of the affiliated department or college.
To request a new exception account, please visit the Service

To request to renew or delete an exception account, visit the Service Catalog and submit a “
