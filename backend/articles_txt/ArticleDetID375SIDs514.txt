MyMedia - Publicly Shared Playlist
Note: Playlist should only be shared with external users. For sharing playlists with a class, the

Playlists are a series of videos that will play one after another in the order set on the playlist.
To make a playlist or add videos to a playlist:
Go to a video you would like in the playlist
Click Actions and then Add to playlist
NOTE: If you have not agreed to terms and conditions for the specific media, you will see the notification as shown below. Click Edit > Agree to terms and conditions >Save.
Go to the Media you just edited (agreed terms and conditions to) >Actions >Add to Playlist.
If you have made the playlist you want to add it to already, click the box. Otherwise, create new playlist by clicking on the + Create New Playlist > Type the Title > Create.
