Students: Conferences makes it easy to conduct synchronous (real-time) discussions within your course. Conferences allows you to broadcast real-time audio, video, share presentation slides, and share any other online resources.

Your instructor may invite you to course-wide conferences or set up personal conferences. If you cannot create a conference at the course level, this feature has been disabled. You can set up your own conferences in Student Groups.

Instructors: Conferences are primarily used for virtual lectures, virtual office hours, and student groups. They can also be used to demonstrate technologies or troubleshoot technology issues online. Conferences can accommodate up to 100 people.
