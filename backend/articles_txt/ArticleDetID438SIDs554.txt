Students: Pages posted by your instructor may include instructional materials or other resources. Some Pages are read only, while other you may be able to edit. It depends on how your instructor has set up the Page and what it is being used for.

Pages in student groups are a good place to collaborate on projects. Groups can use Pages to collaborate on documents, share content, or other educational resources. Learn how to see the groups where you are enrolled. (https://guides.instructure.com/m/4212/l/55565?data-resolve-url=true&data-manual-id=4212)

Instructors: Pages are where you can put content and educational resources that are part of your course but don’t necessarily belong in an assignment, or that you want to refer to in multiple assignments. This is a place where you can include text, video, and links to your files. You can even make links to other Pages or link to a Page from an Assignment, Quiz, or Announcement. Pages can also be used as a collaboration tool where you can create class wikis and set specific user access for each page. Canvas keeps the entire history of the page so you can see how it changes over time.
