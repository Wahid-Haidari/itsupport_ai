OUNetID accounts can become locked causing the user to not have access to various campus sites. Here are some reasons this can occur:

New Password Policy â€“ OU has implemented a new annual password change policy taking effect February 22nd 2017. Users who have not changed their password in over a year will have their password expired. Please see this article (https://itsupport.ou.edu/TDClient/30/Unified/KB/ArticleDet?ID=265) for more information on what to do if your password has expired.

The wrong password was entered more than 3 times. (Most common cause of this error message.)

The password was recently changed password but a mobile device is still connected to your OU email with the old password.

If you are unable to access your OU account and the site says your account is locked you will need to contact OU IT by calling 325-HELP (4357).
