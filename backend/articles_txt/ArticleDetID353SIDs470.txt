Adobe Creative Cloud Disk Space Usage Problem
Adobe Creative Cloud Disk Space Usage Problem
Users of Adobe Creative Cloud may notice system sluggishness or slowdown due to the Creative Cloud ACC.log file taking up a large amount of disk space. Adobe recommends users either update to the latest version of Creative Cloud or delete the ACC.log file.
Solution 1: Update to the latest version of Creative Cloud
In most cases, Creative Cloud downloads and installs the update automatically when you sign in. If you’re unable to sign in from the Creative Cloud application, then do the following:
Open a browser and navigate to
https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/help/creative-cloud-desktop.html
.
Sign in with the Adobe ID associated with your Creative Cloud account.
Download and install the latest version of the Creative Cloud app.
Launch Creative Cloud and sign in.
Solution 2: Restart the system. Delete the ACC.log file, then start the Creative Cloud desktop app
You can safely delete the ACC.log file from your computer.
To do so, navigate to one of the following folders and delete the acc.log files:
Windows 7/8: \Users\[user name]\AppData\Local\Temp
Mac OS X: ~/Library/Logs/
Note: Some files and folders are hidden on Windows. See
Show hidden files, folders, filename extensions | Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, 8
for more information.
Note: The user Library folder is hidden on Mac OS 10.7 and later. See
Access hidden user library files | Mac OS 10.7 and later
for more information.
