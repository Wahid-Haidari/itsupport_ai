Ordering Machine Captions from MyMedia
Ordering Machine Captions from MyMedia
Machine captions are automatically created by MyMedia when a video is uploaded to your account. In the event these captions are not created for your video, the captions can be ordered by following the steps below.
Go to mymedia.ou.edu, click Guest (or your name) in the upper right corner, and then select “My Media” from the list that appears.
Find the video you want to order captions for and click the title of the video.
Scroll down beneath the video player and press the arrow next to Actions. Select “Caption & Enrich” from the list displayed.
Press the blue button that says “+ Order” to fill out the caption order request.
After selecting Machine as Service options for the captions, press the blue “Submit” button to order the captions for your video.
*Note: If Professional is Selected under Service, your captions will not work. This feature is not setup yet. If you need human captioning for your videos, please contact the ADRC at
ADRC@ou.edu
