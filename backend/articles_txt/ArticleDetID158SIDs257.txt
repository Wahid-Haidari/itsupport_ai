Multiplayer Gaming on Campus
Multiplayer Gaming on Campus
Multiplayer network functionality varies by game and system. Unfortunately current OU network infrastructure does not currently support peer to peer connections needed for some games, voice chats and multi-player features. For that reason, some features or games may not work. OU IT is currently working with our vendors to find a solution.
