Qualtrics - Collaboration
Adding Collaborators to your Survey Project
Qualtrics allows for working with collaborators on a survey project. This article covers both collaborating with other members of the OU community and collaborating with people outside the university.
Collaborating with other OU faculty, staff, or students
To collaborate with others at OU, everyone must first activate their Qualtrics accounts. For information on activating your account visit the first-time login article for your campus:
Norman
OKC
Tulsa
Once everyone has an active account, follow the steps below to add OU collaborators.
Open the survey builder. This is the default page when you first open the survey.
Click the
Tools
dropdown menu.
Select
Collaborate.
Select
User and Group Address Book
.
NOTE: Using this method will ensure that the survey is linked correctly between the accounts and eliminates the need to accept a sharing invitation or use a collaboration code.
Search for the person you wish to collaborate with.
Select their account from the list. If they are not on the list, they may not have activated their OU account yet.
Click
Add Selected.
Select what permissions your collaborator should have. Qualtrics has an article about
Collaboration Permissions
if you would like more information.
Click
Save.
Collaborating with people outside OU
OU accounts can collaborate with accounts outside OU. Visit Qualtrics’ help article on
Collaborating Outside your Organization
for more information and step-by-step instructions.
