Course Level Roles in Canvas
The roles outlined below are the default roles available in Canvas courses. Colleges and departments may have additional customized roles for their academic units; if you have questions about course roles not listed below, we recommend that you contact your department directly.
It is important to assign course roles to users as needed, especially when considering access to sensitive information such as student submissions/grades. We recommend that you identify minimal permissions needed to perform class duties before granting course access to a colleague or another user.
As a reminder, instructors should refrain from manually adding students to courses (unless there is a demonstrated need). Officially-enrolled students are automatically added to courses when they register. If, for some reason, you do need to add a user to your Canvas course, please add them by OUNetID (4x4) or OUID; adding by email creates a 2
nd
Canvas account for the user, which then requires a merging of accounts.
