How do my parents make payments to my account on one.ou.edu?
In order for a non-student (such as a parent) to pay a tuition or housing bill for an OU Student, the student must authorize the creation of a third-party user account through ONE:
On the home page, click on the “Financial” Tab
Click “Bursar”.
Click the option for “Add authorized users.”
Enter the e-mail address that you wish to authorize.
Check the “I agree box”
Click “continue.”
The person which you wish to authorize will be sent two e-mails, one with a username, a second with a password.
If the authorized person gets locked out of the account or loses authorization, the student will need to create a new authorization through the same steps.
Detailed instructions are at
http://www.ou.edu/content/dam/bursar/documents/Add%20Authorized%20Users(ONE).pdf
If you need help using the bursar system in ONE you should contact the main bursar line at 325-3121.
