WiFi Troubleshooting
If you are having problems connecting or staying connected to the OU wireless networks, please try the troubleshooting suggestions below.
1. Forget WIFI@OU and OUGuest on your device.
If your computer has saved the settings for OU wireless in the past, it may have problems reconnecting if that information has changed in some way. In these situations, it is recommended to remove those saved settings and try to reconnect from scratch.
For more information on forgetting a network, click
here
. Once the connection is forgotten by the operating system, please attempt to reconnect to the connection once again.
Please note: users with an OUNetID should never connect using OUGuest. This can cause connectivity problems even after disconnecting from it.
2. Confirm your OUNet ID and password. Have they changed recently?
For more information on on WIFI@OU, including specific instructions on connecting to it based on device type, click
here
. If you have recently changed your password and if your old one is still saved with the connection, you will need to have your machine forget WIFI@OU using the instructions above, then re-add the connection which should finally prompt for your username and updated password.
3. Update Intel drivers, and install any other available device updates.
Some users are experiencing connectivity issues in various buildings on campus. This is possibly because the Intel driver version they are using is not compatible with a new wifi protocol that has been released.
