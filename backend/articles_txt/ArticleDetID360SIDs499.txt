Kaltura Capture: Uploading
Kaltura Capture: Uploading
To upload a previously saved video, you must open the Kaltura Capture Desktop App and navigate to the
“Library”
Tab.
If you need to edit the video’s title, description, and/or tags, make sure to do so before uploading the video to MyMedia. To do so, simply click on the current title of the video. Make the necessary changes and click
Save & Upload.
Alternatively, if no changes need to be made, you can select the recording you would like to upload and click the
Upload
button from the library tab.
You should receive a notification, and find a link to the recording after your video completes its upload in the Library Tab.
NOTE: It may take several minutes for the media to appear in “My Media”. If you’re having issues, attempt refreshing your browser.
