Student Directory Holds
Student Directory Holds
A Directory Hold forces the university to withhold all student information from release. This includes OU Search, Global Address Book in OU Exchange, etc. Having a directory hold also limits account modifications a user can make when calling OU IT Services. The hold will require the user to go in person to an IT Service Center and provide a photo ID for any account modifications. Also note that a Directory Hold can also preclude potential employers from being able to access your information.
The only way to add or remove a Directory Hold is to go to Buchanan Hall, Office of Academic Records and fill out a “
Request to Withhold Student Directory Information
“. Academic Records can be contacted at 405-325-4147 for additional information.
