Canvas - Student View
Canvas - Student View
You can view a course the same way that your students view your course through Student View. Enabling Student View creates a Test Student in your course. You can also activate Student View in your Course Settings.
To see the student's perspective on Canvas, use Student View to view the course, post and reply to discussions, submit assignments, view grades, view people, view pages, view the syllabus, view quizzes, view the calendar, and view the scheduler (if enabled).
You can reset Test Student data at any time; however, Test Student activity that involves interactions with other students cannot be removed, such as discussion replies. Test Student data that involves interactions with other students are retained even if the test student is removed from section enrollments.
Attendance, conferences, conversations inbox, collaborations, differentiated assignments, external apps, groups, peer reviews, and profiles do not work for the Test Student. You will see only what you, as the instructor, allow your students to see.
Open Student View
You can access Student View from most areas of the course including Home, Modules, Assignments, Announcements, Discussions, Quizzes, Pages, Syllabus, and Outcomes.
To view the page as a test student, click the
Student View
button.
View Course
You can now view the course as a student user would see it. For example, students cannot see the Settings navigation link like instructors can.
You will know if you are in Student View because of the colored box on the bottom of the screen indicating you are logged into Student View.
Reset Student
You can also reset the Test Student by clicking
Reset Student
. This action will clear all activity that does not include any student interaction.
For example, if you created an assignment and submitted it as the Test Student but then forgot to add a certain submission type, you can click the Reset Student button and submit the assignment again as the Test Student.
Leave Student View
To return to your course to the instructor's view, click the
Leave Student View
button.
