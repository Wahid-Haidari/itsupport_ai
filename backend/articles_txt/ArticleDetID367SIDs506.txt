MyMedia – Collaborations
The Collaborations tab in the video editing portion of MyMedia allows you to credit other users who contributed to your project.
Log in at mymedia.ou.edu with your OUNetID and password
Click on the tab with
your name
(or
log in
) and then
My Media
on the top menu.
Choose which video you would like information about.
Underneath the lower-right-hand corner of the video, there exists a drop-down menu called
Actions
; select
Edit
from it.
This will bring you to the
General Editing Menu
. This view allows you to preview your video, and choose a number of options using the tabs under the video.
Clicking on the
Collaborations Tab
will bring up selected users that are allowed to edit the content metadata and related assets (such as caption files), and/or allowed to publish.
The “
Add Collaborator
” button on the bottom right allows for additions of authorized accounts as Co-editors, Co-publishers, Co-Viewers or all.
Note
: Users
must
have logged in to MyMedia
at least once
before to be added as a Collaborator.
The final drop-down menu allows you to organize Collaborator listing to either Co-Editors, Co-Publishers, Co-Viewers or all, with a corresponding table for easy management. Click on Add when finished.
