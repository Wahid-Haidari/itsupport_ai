PingID Replacing Duo for Multi-Factor Authentication
OU IT has transitioned from Duo to PingID for multi-factor authentication (MFA), which is required for mobile and off-network access to enterprise software and services like your OU/OUHSC email and PeopleSoft.
Multi-factor authentication is a critical component of a secure IT environment that enables you to verify your identity using your phone or other personal device and prevents unauthorized users from logging into your account, even if they know your password.
Recommended Actions
Enroll in PingID now
to eliminate any disruptions to your access. For instructions on enrolling,
click here
. There are several different ways to authenticate using PingID, such as a mobile app, a desktop app, a phone call, text message, or using a physical security token (such as a YubiKey).
OU IT recommends registering several different methods of authentication, such as installing the app on both a mobile device and registering a phone number to receive passcodes via call or text (SMS).
Users who choose to register just one device/method have an increased risk of being unable to access their accounts in a timely manner due to losing access to the single device/method.
Install the mobile app for
Apple or Android devices
, including ipads.
Install the
desktop app
to authenticate using your Windows or Mac desktop/laptop
Register your phone number
to receive a passcode via phone call or SMS (text message)

Failing to Approve a PingID Prompt Authentication
For sites and applications that require PingID, ignoring or not approving the authentication prompt will fail to load the site or application in question. This can result in one not being able to access the service, or content updates not being downloaded.
In Outlook, this may mean that you will not receive your latest mail.
In applications like OneDrive or Teams, you may receive messages like "There was a problem signing you in" or "We're sorry, we've run into an issue". This may also lock up the application and make it difficult to exit while it waits on the needed PingID approval.
For websites, your screen may hang or stop loading after submitting your user name and password as it waits for approval from your PingID authentication method.
Common Issues After Enrollment
Mobile App - If you are not receiving the push notifications, check your phone's notification settings. You may also opt to open the app and approve any prompts.
Computer App - You must locate and open the app on your computer in order to view the passcode needed to authenticate.
SMS Text or Voice Passcode - If you are not receiving a phone call or text, ensure that your phone is not set to "Do Not Disturb".
