PingID Authentication for Desktop App (Windows, Mac)
PingID Authentication for Desktop App (Windows, Mac)
PingID
enables you to sign on to all your applications with the added security of multifactor authentication. Use the PingID desktop app to generate a one-time passcode (OTP) from your computer that you can use to authenticate. Please note this app will need to remain installed if you choose this method, as desktop app authentication prompts will appear in this application. If you have accidentally uninstalled the app and no longer have the ability to authenticate, please see this
article
