Zoom has introduced Focus Mode (https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360061113751#h_01FCC38MY9T4PAHYF8Q075500H) which helps students to stay attentive or work on their tasks while under supervision, without being distracted by others and their tasks. This allows the host and cohost to see videos of all participants without other participants seeking each other. This feature also helps with screen sharing feature as it allows the host to switch and view all participantâ€™s shared screen, while the participants can only view their own content. Host can also allow any shared screen to be viewable by all participants.
