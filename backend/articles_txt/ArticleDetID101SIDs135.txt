Static IP Requests
A static IP address provided through OU IT may be necessary for legacy printing (such as CICS printers) and off-campus access (of servers, for instance). Dynamic addressing via DHCP should be attempted before requesting a static IP address.
A static IP address will prevent the device using it from changing IP addresses each time it connects. This type of IP address is called a dynamic IP address, and is the standard method of assigning IP addresses.
If you would like to request a Static IP address, please
