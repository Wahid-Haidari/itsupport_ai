What is Respondus Lockdown Browser?
For Faculty
: Respondus Lockdown Browser (LDB) is a secure browser for taking tests in Canvas. The lockdown browser is suited for taking tests in a proctored environment, such as in-class exams or in testing center. In order to take an exam using Lockdown Browser, students would need to install Lockdown Browser on their personal computers.
Respondus Lockdown Browser
offers the following benefits:
Prevent students from copying and pasting exam contents
Prevent students from taking screen captures
Prevent students from printing the exam
Prevent students from accessing other applications or websites
Allows for linking to external content from within the exam (e.g. externally hosted photos/videos).
Allows for test results to be displayed in a secure manner
Faculty can add the Respondus LDB Dashboard to their course by:
Clicking on
Settings
, then
Navigation
.
Scrolling to the bottom of the page, they will see the
LockDown Browser
Drag that box to the top column, scroll to the bottom of the page, and hit
Save
. Alternatively, they can also click the three dots on the right side of the
LockDown Browser
box, click on
Enable
, then scroll to the bottom of the page and hit
Save
.
Once that is done, instructors can then access the dashboard from the course navigation and designate the quizzes/exams that will require LockDown Browser and make changes to those settings.
For Students:
Respondus LockDown Browser is a secure browser used for taking online exams and quizzes within your Canvas course(s). It is not required for all quizzes, only those where the instructor specifically requires their use. If Lockdown Browser is required for your class, you will need to install it on your computer (if you haven’t already). If a Canvas quiz requires that Respondus LockDown Browser be used, the exam won’t be accessible with a standard web browser, you will need to have the Respondus Lockdown Browser installed.
