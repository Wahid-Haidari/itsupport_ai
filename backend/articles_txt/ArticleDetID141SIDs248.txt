Connecting to WIFI@OU with Windows 7/8/8.1
Connecting to WIFI@OU with Windows 7/8/8.1
What is wrong with Windows 7/8/8.1?
There is a known issue with verifying certificates in Windows 7/8/8.1. Anyone on the OU campus using those versions of Windows will need to uncheck a box to not verify the certificate to get on WIFI@OU. We generally recommend not using these OS, but if your work requires it, please proceed below.
What do I do?
Click the Windows Start menu and navigate to Control Panel > Network and Sharing Center > Manage wireless networks.
Click on the
Add
button.
Choose
Manually create a network profile
.
Enter the following information:
Network name: WIFI@OU
Security type: WPA2-Enterprise
Encryption Type: AES or TKIP
Click on
Next
to proceed to the following step.
Click on Change connection settings.
From the Security tab, choose Microsoft: Protected EAP as the network authentication method.
Click
Settings
Uncheck
“Verify the server’s identity…”
To bring up the EAP MSCHAPv2 Properties prompt to uncheck the box, select Configure under Select Authentication Method.
Uncheck Automatically use my Windows logon on name and password if the computer is not on the SOONER domain.
Additional Troubleshooting
If the above steps do not work, you may need to enable single sign on in the advanced network settings.
Go to Start > Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center, then in the left-hand column, click Manage network connections.
Right-click Local Area Connections and select Properties.
Navigate to the Security tab, and then click Advanced settings.
Check the box labeled "Enable single sign on for this network".
