Qualtrics – Useful Features and Tools
Qualtrics – Useful Features and Tools
Customize the Survey Experience
Qualtrics has many useful features that can assist with automating tasks and customizing surveys to individual respondents. Below are selected resources on some of the most commonly used tools.
Display Logic
When you apply Display Logic to a question, it will only display if certain conditions are met. These conditions might include how a respondent answered a previous question, embedded data, or other information. This tool works best if you only need to conditionally display individual questions. If you need to conditionally display whole sections of a survey, it may be better to use
Survey Flow
to create
Branch Logic
.

Display Logic
.
Skip Logic
Skip Logic can be used to send a respondent to a later point in a survey based on how they answer a question. For example, if a respondent answers that they do not consent to participate, they can be skipped to the end of the survey. If your survey is complex and requires multiple skips, you may consider using
Survey Flow
to create
Branch Logic
instead.

Skip Logic
.
Note: If you would like filtered out respondents to have a customized end of survey message, you can achieve this using Survey Flow and Branch Logic.
Survey Flow
Survey Flow can be used to add different pathways into your survey. This can be automated to send respondents down particular branches based on their responses, randomization, embedded data, and more.

Survey Flow
.
Survey Flow also contains several Elements to give you high levels of control of both respondents’ experiences and of how your data is collected. These tools can include functionality such as authentication, randomization, and alternative end of survey messages, among others.

Survey Flow Elements
.
Question Blocks
Question Blocks can be used to split the survey up into sections. One Question Block will show per page. They can be useful for breaking up the survey into chunks to reduce the need for respondents to scroll, or in Survey Flow to customize the survey experience.

Question Blocks
.
Page Breaks
By default, each
Question Block
will be a single page in a survey. If you need additional Page Breaks within Question Blocks, these can be added manually. Some other tools (including Piped Text) in Qualtrics
interact with Page Breaks
in different ways.

Page Breaks
.
Response and Validation Requirements
Response and Validation Requirements can be used to request or require that participants answer a question before continuing, or to require a specific type of answer, such as an email address. Response and Validation Requirements are added to individual questions.

Response and Validation Requirements
.
Piped Text
Piped Text is a powerful tool with a wide range of applications. It allows you to pull data from elsewhere (including a text response from a previous question, embedded data, and more) and display it to respondents within a question.

Piped Text
.
Workflows
Workflows are used to automate tasks either on a schedule or based on events. For example, they can be used to send emails to yourself, other researchers, or respondents whenever a response is recorded. Event based Workflows can be fine-tuned with conditional logic. Workflows can also interact with Salesforce.

Workflows
.
Note: Email triggers are no longer recommended as Qualtrics has ended support for this feature. Workflows are recommended as an updated alternative.
