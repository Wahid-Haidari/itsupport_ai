Canvas – Creating a Turnitin Assignment with the External Tool
Canvas – Creating a Turnitin Assignment with the External Tool
Note:
The Turnitin Plagiarism Framework is the recommended method for setting up Turnitin within Canvas, as it is a smoother integration than the External Tool. Visit
our
article on the Plagiarism Framework
for more in
formation.
Turnitin is enabled on a per-assignment basis in Canvas. The Turnitin LTI (external tool) currently includes a few limitations when creating assignments:
You cannot use Turnitin
LTI with group assignments.
Turnitin
LTI assignments cannot include more than one submission date; differentiated due dates are not supported.
You cannot restrict student submission types. By
default, Turnitin always allows students to submit their assignment as a text entry or upload any supported file type: Text (.txt), Microsoft Word (.doc/.docx), Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt/.pptx), Postcript (.ps), Portable Document Format (.pdf), Rich Text Format (.rtf), HyperText Markup Language (.html), WordPerfect (.wp), Hangul (.hwp), or Open Office (.odt/.ods/.odp). They can also upload an assignment from Google Drive or Dropbox. Turnitin does not allow students to submit unsupported file types.
The
TurnItIn LTI does not support multiple file submissions from students; each previous submission will be overwritten.
If you want to use
a Canvas rubric for the assignment, you must
add the rubric
before setting the External Tool submission type. Create the assignment with any other submission type, save the assignment, add the rubric, and then edit the assignment to select the External Tool.
