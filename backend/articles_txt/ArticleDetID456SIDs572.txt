Note: The Turnitin Plagiarism Framework is the recommended method for setting up Turnitin within Canvas, as it is a smoother integration than the External Tool. Visit our article on the Plagiarism Framework (https://itsupport.ou.edu/TDClient/30/Unified/KB/ArticleDet?ID=404) for more information.

You cannot restrict student submission types. By default, Turnitin always allows students to submit their assignment as a text entry or upload any supported file type: Text (.txt), Microsoft Word (.doc/.docx), Microsoft PowerPoint (.ppt/.pptx), Postcript (.ps), Portable Document Format (.pdf), Rich Text Format (.rtf), HyperText Markup Language (.html), WordPerfect (.wp), Hangul (.hwp), or Open Office (.odt/.ods/.odp). They can also upload an assignment from Google Drive or Dropbox. Turnitin does not allow students to submit unsupported file types.

If you want to use a Canvas rubric for the assignment, you must add the rubric (https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-2870) before setting the External Tool submission type. Create the assignment with any other submission type, save the assignment, add the rubric, and then edit the assignment to select the External Tool.
